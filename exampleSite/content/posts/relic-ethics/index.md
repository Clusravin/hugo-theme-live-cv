The allure of cursed artifacts is undeniable—each relic carries a unique energy, a story etched in dark enchantments. But as I’ve delved deeper into artifact containment research, one question repeatedly haunts my mind: Are there some relics too dangerous to keep, even in the name of knowledge?

I recently examined a hex-bound relic known as the Veilstone Chalice, a cup steeped in a curse that seems to drain vitality from anything nearby. Containing it required an immense, double-layered protection protocol, and even then, it showed an unpredictable resonance with nearby magic. This raises a crucial ethical dilemma: At what point does the risk to practitioners, even to bystanders, outweigh the benefits of studying such objects?

In the coming weeks, I plan to discuss this topic with fellow researchers at the Institute for Occult Sciences. Our field needs clear guidelines on which artifacts are worth the risk and which should be neutralized for safety. Knowledge is power, yes, but in dark arts, wielding power responsibly sometimes means walking away.
