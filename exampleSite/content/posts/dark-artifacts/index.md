In the last few months, I’ve had the privilege—and the challenge—of working with some of the most dangerous relics documented to date. These objects, steeped in curses, represent millennia of arcane history, yet we’re only beginning to understand the depth of their power and risks.

One critical lesson is that stability can hinge on even the smallest factors: a slight increase in ambient magical energy can activate curses unexpectedly. My team’s newest containment protocol, which we developed based on recent artifact failures, emphasizes double-enchantment barriers, an innovation that we hope will prevent further 'field surprises.'

Looking forward, I’ll be presenting some of these findings at next year’s Annual Dark Arts Summit, where I aim to address the question many have asked—can these cursed artifacts be ethically and safely used for the greater good? I’ll leave that open for now, but I’ll continue to document what I find.
