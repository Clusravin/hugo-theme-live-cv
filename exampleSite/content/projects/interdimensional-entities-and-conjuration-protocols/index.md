This project focuses on the summoning, control, and containment of interdimensional entities, a highly challenging area within dark arts that involves conjuring beings from other realms. Raymond's work addresses the ethical concerns surrounding these practices, as well as the potential dangers associated with unstable conjurations. Through rigorous fieldwork and experimental summoning, he has developed protocols for safer conjuration environments and containment fields that protect practitioners and surrounding spaces. This research also examines the potential beneficial uses of conjured entities in protective and restorative capacities, challenging the traditional view of such beings as purely malevolent.
