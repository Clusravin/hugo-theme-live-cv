    <p>Working in summoning and conjuration often feels like walking a razor&rsquo;s edge. The thrill of channeling powerful, ancient forces is undeniable, but so too is the responsibility that comes with it. In my recent research on conjured entities, I’ve realized that ethical practices must adapt to the changing landscape of dark arts. This isn’t about wielding power but about understanding its true scope and ramifications.</p>
<p>One area I’m currently focused on is the balance between control and autonomy when dealing with conjured beings. Traditional containment spells often impose harsh restrictions on entities, sometimes sparking unpredictable reactions. My team and I are developing &lsquo;sympathetic conjurations,&rsquo; which allow for a respectful balance of autonomy, mitigating the risk of volatility while maintaining control.</p>

        <strong><a href="https://clusravin.github.io/hugo-theme-live-cv/posts/relic-ethics/">Relic Ethics: Where Do We Draw the Line?</a></strong>

        <div class="summary">
    <p>The allure of cursed artifacts is undeniable—each relic carries a unique energy, a story etched in dark enchantments. But as I’ve delved deeper into artifact containment research, one question repeatedly haunts my mind: Are there some relics too dangerous to keep, even in the name of knowledge?</p>
<p>I recently examined a hex-bound relic known as the Veilstone Chalice, a cup steeped in a curse that seems to drain vitality from anything nearby. Containing it required an immense, double-layered protection protocol, and even then, it showed an unpredictable resonance with nearby magic. This raises a crucial ethical dilemma: At what point does the risk to practitioners, even to bystanders, outweigh the benefits of studying such objects?</p>
